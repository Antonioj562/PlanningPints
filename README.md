## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble figuring out how to get the routing for the detailed page figured out. I wasn't sure how the routeing should look and chatGPT couldn't assit me. Evenetually a friend of mine helped debug the code with me. Then from there I was able to get the routeing functionale. Then I further understood how the routing works and how to expand on that. I struggled with also how I could form my data from my API into a graph as it was locations of breweries.
